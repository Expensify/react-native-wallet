# react-native-wallet

## Features
- ⚛️ Card Push Provisioning seamless integration
- ♻️ Universal solution (Apple Wallet and Google Wallet)
- 💳 Easy and secure addition of payment cards from your app directly

## Getting started

Using the `react-native-wallet` Push Provisioning features requires proper configuration and access from both Google and Apple. 
Please follow the instructions below before installing the library:

### Android

To be able to interact with the Google Wallet on the Android please make sure to complete all of the steps below following [the Google Push Provisioning documentation](https://developers.google.com/pay/issuers/apis/push-provisioning/android/setup):

#### Step 1: Get access to Google TapAndPay SDK

1. Visit [the Google Pay Android Push Provisioning API documentation](https://developers.google.com/pay/issuers/apis/push-provisioning/android/) and request access to it.

2. Once getting an approval from the Google team
	2.1. Download the [TapAndPay SDK](https://developers.google.com/pay/issuers/apis/push-provisioning/android/releases). 
	2.2. Unzip it and extract the SDK into the `/android/libs` folder in your React Native project (if there is no `libs` folder, create one). 
	2.3. Add `/android/libs` to `.gitignore`.
	
3. Then connect the SDK to your project in `build.gradle`, for example like in [example/android/build.gradle](https://github.com/Expensify/react-native-wallet/blob/main/example/android/build.gradle):

```groovy
allprojects {
	repositories {
		*// ...*
		google()
		maven { url "file://${rootDir}/libs" }
	}
}
```

#### Step 2: Whitelist your app for SDK use.

To use the Google SDK in your app, you will need to whitelist your app details. Without it, calling some functions will result in a `Not verified` error. 
To resolve it, please follow the instructions from [the official Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/pay/issuers/apis/push-provisioning/android/allowlist).

For your builds, you will need to prepare your app's `package name` and `fingerprint` following [these steps](https://developers.google.com/pay/issuers/apis/push-provisioning/android/allowlist#how_to_get_your_apps_fingerprint). The values should, for example, look like this:

```
Package name: com.app.package.name

Fingerprint: SHA256: 36:38:63:59:6E:...:00:82:16:4E:FF
```
> [!TIP]
> You can display your SHA-256 certificate checksum using `apksigner` or `keytool`.


With all the required data, submit the form and wait for Google's response. After successfully whitelisting your app you will be able to use Google SDK within our library.

#### Step 3: Test your app

Before publishing your app with implemented In-App Push Provisioning, you will need to send your app for Google review. 
More information about it can be found in the [Deploying your app](#deploying-your-app) section below.

### iOS

## Installation

After completing the setup from the section above, install the `react-native-wallet` package from npm:

```sh
npm install @expensify/react-native-wallet

or

yarn add @expensify/react-native-wallet
```

## Usage

```js
import {multiply} from '@expensify/react-native-wallet';

*// ...*

const result = multiply(3, 7);
```

## Required data 
Here you can find data elements used in the library, essential to work with Google Wallet and Apple Wallet APIs.

- **Opaque Payment Card** (OPC) - a binary blob of information Google Pay receives from the issuer app that could be presented to TSP to receive a token.
-  **Token Service Provider** (TSP) - a service that enhances payment security by replacing your credit card number during transactions with a unique digital identifier - token. The TSP specifies the tokenization service used to create a given token e.g. Visa, MasterCard, American Express. 
- **PAN** (personal account number) - the 15 or 16-digit number that appears on a credit card to identify the account.
- **DPAN** (dynamic personal account number) - refers to the 15 or 16-digit account number associated with a token. Each PAN will be given a different DPAN for each Wallet, e.g. if you tokenize the same PAN into two different wallets it will have two different DPANs.
-  **Token Reference ID** - a unique identifying number to refer to a DPAN. Token Providers will assign each DPAN an issuer token ID at the time of tokenization.
- **Nonce** - a one-time nonce value generated by Apple’s servers. This nonce must be included in the add payment request’s encrypted data.
- **Nonce Signature** - the device-specific signature for the nonce. This signature must be included in the add payment request’s encrypted data.
- **Certificates** - an array of NSData objects. Each object contains a DER encoded X.509 certificate, with the leaf first and root last. You must download the root CA to validate the entire chain.
- **Encrypted Pass Data**- an encrypted JSON file containing the sensitive information needed to add a card to Apple Pay. [Details here.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/pkaddpaymentpassrequest/encryptedpassdata)
- **Ephemeral Public Key** - a key used by elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).

# API Reference
The library offers five functions for seamless integration and use of the Apple Wallet and Google Wallet APIs. Additionally, it includes one listener that informs when the added card has been activated. Below, these functions are described along with the data types involved.

## Functions

# Publishing your app

To successfully publish your app, you will need to navigate through a series of mandatory test cases on both platforms.

### Android

Before deploying your app to the Google Play Store, make sure you have taken care of the security when implementing Push Provisioning and properly tested your code. To accomplish it, please familiarize yourself with [the Google's App Push Provisioning best practices](https://developers.google.com/pay/issuers/apis/push-provisioning/android/best-practices).

The latest information about deploying apps with Google TapAndPay SDK can be found in the [pre-launch process](https://developers.google.com/pay/issuers/apis/push-provisioning/android/launch-process#step_3_issuer_app_product_review) and [beta tests](https://developers.google.com/pay/issuers/apis/push-provisioning/android/beta-testing) sections in Google documentation. Make sure to complete all of the steps specified by Google connected to the __Google's branding__, __API safety__, and __app stability__.

Before publishing your app, it will need to be reviewed by Google. During this process, it will need to pass 4 mandatory test cases that are specified [here](https://developers.google.com/pay/issuers/apis/push-provisioning/android/test-cases). They verify how your app handles card state tracking in different scenarios. 

> [!NOTE]
>Please make sure to hide the `Add to Google Wallet` buttons when cards are already added to the wallet.
